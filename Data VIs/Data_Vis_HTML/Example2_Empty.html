            John Ernst Steinbeck, Jr. (February 27,
            1902 â€“ December 20, 1968) was an Ameri-
            can writer. He is widely known for the
            Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Grapes
            of Wrath (1939) and East of Eden (1952)
            and the novella Of Mice and Men (1937).
            As the author of twenty-seven books,
            including sixteen novels, six non-fiction
            books, and five collections of short sto-
            ries, Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize

            <p>
                Set during the Great Depression, the
                novel focuses on the Joads, a poor fam-
                ily of tenant farmers driven from their
                Oklahoma home by drought, economic hard-
                ship, and changes in financial and agri-
                cultural industries. Due to their nearly
                hopeless situation, and in part because
                they were trapped in the Dust Bowl, the
                Joads set out for California. Along with
                of other "Okies", they sought jobs, land,
                dignity, and a future.

            <b>Football</b>
            <i>Football</i> refers to a number of
            sports that involve, to varying de-
            grees, kicking a ball with the foot
            to score a goal.
            <strong>American football</strong>, known as
            football in the <em>United States</em>, is a
            team sport played between two teams
            of 11 players with an oval ball on a
            rectangular field 120 yards long and
            53.3 yards wide with goalposts at
            either end.
