What are the noticeable differences in the winning percent and price percent distributions 
between chocolate and non-chocolate candy? Describe the trends you see in detail based on 
your visualization. 



Based on my visualizations it seems to me that chocolate candy seems to be more expensive on average then non chocolate candy, and we can also see that the Non-Chocolate win percentage is grouped around the 40% point where the Chocolate win-percentage is grouped around the 60% point. Meaning that Chocolate candy tends to win more often then non-chocolate candy does at a roughly 60-40 rate.
